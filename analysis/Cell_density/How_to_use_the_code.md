For cell type density analysis:

Step1: run the 1.0 to curate the data
Step2: run the 1.1 to generate the cell types and density in HIP region
Step3: run 2.0 to run the limma analysis on the hemi effect
Step4: run 2.1 on the sex effect
you can run 1.2 to plot the correlations between each cell type.
